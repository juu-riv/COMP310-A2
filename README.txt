The code uses the starter code provided by the OS team.
For my shell, I decided to use two different functions. The one provided to separate the line into arguments and another one to separate the different commands when chaining. It made the separation of concerns much easier even though it adds loops to the shell execution. It was a trade-off that I was willing to have.
